# Akinator
A character guessing game project

This is a project that mimics famous Akinator game. The tree structure is used here to store all known characters and their defining attribute. User answers the questions until a program gets to a leaf in the database tree structure. If character that is stored in that leaf is not what the user quessed the user is asked the defining attribute of that character and the database gets updated. Therefore, the database is growing from game to game and right quesses occur more frequently.
